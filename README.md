## Group Presentations: 
<p>Prioritizing the Inverted Classroom method, students will bear primary responsibility for teaching testable course content. 
In small groups (2-4 Ss), students will do a ~45-minute presentation pertaining to a weekly theme. 
While guidelines and some core material will be posted on Campus, additional research will be required. 
The majority of the presentation should be student-fronted, with the group then <strong>leading the class in a chosen activity 
(debate, role play, games such as Kahoot, Peardeck, etc.)</strong> at their discretion.</p>
</br>


Students will receive both individual and group feedback, as per the chosen rubric (posted on Campus) and based on the overall quality of the presentation,
i.e., preparedness, organization, structure and English language competence; however, the overall grade will be individual, 
thus allowing for exceptions regarding under-preparedness, sub-standard level/register, etc., in individual cases. 
</br>


<i>Note</i>: Instructors reserve the right to stop a sub-standard presentation at any point, grading it accordingly. Due date: Weeks 3 through 7.
</br>


## Suggested Weekly Group Presentation Topics:
<i>Note</i>: These are suggested topics; students should feel free to pursue any/all related interests, as long as their chosen topic is related to the weekly subject. 
Also, two presentations are scheduled during Class 5
</br>

Class 3: AI and the Future of Work: Us vs. Them? Is UBI the Answer?</br>
Class 4: What impact might AI have on our “private” lives (governance, crime, privacy, free will…)?</br>
Class 5a: Were “Designer Babies” Just the Beginning? </br>
Class 5b:  Is Death a Disease to be Cured?</br>
Class 6: What if we could up- and download our minds?</br>
Class 7: What did the future used to look like?</br>

## Juried Assessment: 
In small groups (2-4 Ss), students will use the instructor-chosen rubric to grade and assess one other Group Presentation, as assigned by the instructor. 
Each member of the group will fill-out their own rubric, and then the group members will come to consensus (agreement) on the one rubric to submit to the instructor; 
also, as a group, the jury will compose one 250-300 word written assessment of the presentation, focusing on constructive criticism as well as praise, 
to be submitted to the instructor in confidence, as per his or her instructions (i.e. via email). </br>
<i>Note</i>: Juries should assess other presenters after they’ve presented themselves, with the exception of the first group 
(which should be assessed by the last scheduled group). 

## Due date: 
In accordance with Group Presentations, Weeks 3 through 7. 
Groups should have one week to submit their joint rubric and narrative assessment (two documents total), to be sent via email (Word doc or PDF attachments only) 
to the instructor with their TD and last names in the subject line.
